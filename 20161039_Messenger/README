To compile: (in this order)
>>javac Client.java
>>javac Server.java
>>Javac Peer.java

The folder will then have the corresponding "*.class" files.

To run:
Open two terminals T1 and T2.
T1:~/Alice$ java Peer <portSelfTCP> <portFriendTCP> <username> <friendname>	<portSelfUDP> <portFriendUDP> ( Command line arguments )
T2:~/Bob$ java Peer <portSelfTCP> <portFriendTCP> <username> <friendname> <portSelfUDP> <portFriendUDP>	( Command line arguments )
Execute one instance of the Peer program from different directories to verify File transfer.

For example,
T1: java Peer 5000 6000 Alice Bob 7000 8000
T2: java Peer 6000 5000 Bob Alice 8000 7000

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
Wait for upto ten seconds for both systems to connect to the other, independently. Once both systems connect, use the following functionality.
Messaging: Type your message at a prompt (>>) and it will appear as a sent message on your friend's prompt.

2. UDP:
